## Purpose and Target Audience:

created user stories
https://founderpal.ai/user-persona-generator

**Problem Statement:** The Phone booth libraries are located all across the country making it possible for individuals to borrow and donate books to the collections at specified phone booths. The user finds it difficult to know which books are available prior to reaching the phone booth and is unable to communicate to other users that they have added a new book.

**Purpose:** This book management app will list the available books and show if they are available to borrow. Users will also be able to add a book to the collection as well as edit and delete the book they have added to ensure the application is up-to-date.

**Target Audience:** The primary target audience include avid readers who enjoy using phone booth libraries as well as individuals who want to be apart of a reading community where they can share their thoughts on the books they have completed in the collection.

## User Stories:

## **Wireframe & Initial Design:**

### **Home Page**

### (Logged in) Browse books

### Add a Book

### **Lighthouse Audit :**

https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1?tab=readme-ov-file#testing

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

- On a laptop - add img for pages
- On a mobile device - add img for pages

## **Agile:**

Github issues were used to create the User stories and group them according to MoSCoW prioritization technique. Link to the project with live issues can be found here. The issues are currently in two categories - done or for the next relese.

The issues were than closed automaticaly when the pull request was linked to the issue.

## **Design Choices:**

### Colour scheme:
Colour scheme:
#fafafa - Header
Dark Green - Buttons
#809977 - Footer
The colours were selected with the intention of complementing the hero image and the idea was to ensure the image was  appreciated.

### Typography:

The following fonts were chosen for a clean and modern look that is both readable and minimal.
Varta
Goudy Book Letter 1911

## **Credit :**

- Although I used the django blog resources provided on the LMS, I also received alot of additional clarification by following along with django projects on YouTube. One of the vidoes I found especially helpful was : https://youtu.be/JzDBCZTgVyw?si=w3BBwJswUjBTm1xw

- Stack Overflow was used to solve any smaller bugs and further clarification on errors I was receiving in the terminal.

- I used this site to generate a persona and created user stories: https://founderpal.ai/user-persona-generator

- A special thanks to all the other indivudals in our cohort for their continuous support throughout the course.

- The added book covers and details were taken from the Waterstones Website.

- Font Awesome was used for icons and the fonts used were derived from Google Fonts.

- Wireframes, logo and flowcharts were created using Canva.
